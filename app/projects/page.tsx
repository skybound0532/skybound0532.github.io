        Autonomous Research Sailboats "TINA", "BOB", and "BOBneo"
      </>
    ),
    date: "2025",
    description: (
      <>
        These boats were my work at the Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at UC Berkeley under Professor Reza Alam. I designed the mechanical architecture and all individual components for three generations of autonomous sailboats.
        The boats operate in a mesh network, communicating with each other and a ground station to collect oceanic data over a large area.
        They generally feature the same overall design with a single 2ft ABS tube hull, a large vertical airfoil sail, and a weighted keel for stability.
        The first generation, TINA, was based on the lab's past designs but with improvements to usability and DFM for 3D printing, plus new mounts for a new generation of custom electronics and control systems. In addition, a new sail shaft sealing system and epoxy-coated manufacturing process practically eliminated previous leakage issues.
        However, with the early boats' epoxied design, damaged boats could not be repaired easily and new versions of parts could not be back-ported onto existing boats.
        Thus came BOB, standing for "Bolt On Boat", whose components were all modular. A complex system of gaskets and O-rings kept the boat mostly watertight. Still, BOB was too complicated to assembly and occasionally suffered from leakage at the bolt holes.
        The latest generation, BOBneo ("no entry option"), and its derivative COB ("Clamp On Boat"), eliminated any bolt entry into the hull and proved to be much more reliable.
        Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of BOB in the water. Shown here are two iterations of TINA.

The system came with a nice Fractal Ridge case, but I'm designing a custom 3D printed rack for even greater space efficiency.",

    description: (
      <>
        I wanted a 3D printer that I could bring to college, so I self-sourced and built a modified 350mm Voron 2 printer.
        It's been upgraded many times since first being built, including a Beacon probe, XOL toolhead, Papilio beltdrive extruder, and StealthMax air filter.
        I designed quite a few custom parts for it, including a gantry mounted nozzle wiper, filament runout sensor, and various mounts for all the doodads I've put on it.
        This printer even survived my dorm room getting flooded when my roommate broke a fire sprinkler.
        I've considered upgrading it even more with a 4040 frame and Monolith gantry, but I think I'll put my resources towards the brand new auto-bed clearing design I'm working on instead.

The 3D printed chassis was designed with three goals in mind: easy access to all electronics, compact size to avoid hitting walls, and modularity to easily iterate on the hardware.

        Created as part of a team in the Software Engineering 2 class under Dr. Derek Miller. It is a React webapp that displays time and scheduling information based on customizable schedules, meant to help teachers keep track of my high school's five different bell schedules which changed based on the day of the week and special events.
        The admin frontend allowed teachers to create and modify schedules and edit their clock display with drag and drop widgets like weather and current class name.
        The backend used OAuth2 with the school's Google Workspace and the entire system was deployed on a standalone Raspberry Pi with the client and admin frontend accessed through the school network.
