Created as part of a team in the Software Engineering 2 class under Dr. Derek Miller.

It is a React webapp that displays time and scheduling information based on customizable schedules. It is meant to help teachers keep track of my high school's five different bell schedules, which changed based on the day of the week and special events.

The admin frontend allowed teachers to create and modify schedules and edit their clock display with drag and drop widgets like weather and current class name. The backend used OAuth2 with the school's Google Workspace. The entire system was deployed on a standalone Raspberry Pi with the client and admin frontend accessed through the school network.
